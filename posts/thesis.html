			I wrote my senior thesis on the primal-dual method for approximation 
			algorithms. More specifically, the thesis explores the relationship between 
			problems in combinatorial optimization and those in linear programming. I 
			look specifically at the Hungarian Algorithm, which anticipated this 
			relationship. Find the thesis in its entirety
