			Hello, I'm Zachary Campbell. I recently graduated from Reed 
			College, where I studied mathematics and computer science. My favorite 
			areas of study were computability and complexity, algorithms, and 
			cryptography. I wrote my senior thesis on the primal-dual method as motivated 
			by the Hungarian Algorithm, which solves the assignment problem in polynomial 
			time.</p>
